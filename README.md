# password-generator
an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria they've selected

## Description

    This application was created to help employees/users generate a strong password with varibale criteria. Working on this application helped me become better versed in JavaScript language aspects with the usage of loops, conditionals, arrays, prompts, confirms, and event-listeners

    This application implements JavaScript to seamlessly create a unique password for the user to use for any account they deem necessary

## Usage

    When thre user opens this application they will be greeted with a window for their generated passsword. Upon clicking the 'Generate Password' button, they will be prompted to choose criteria. First they will be asked to choose a character number between 8 and 128. If they choose something outside of this criteria they will be prompted again. the user is then confirmed for the criteria they want to include. If they want the password to meet that criteria they will select 'ok', if they do not want to include that criteria, they will select 'cancel'. After the user enters this information, the window will display their generated password.
